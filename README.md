# Remote Vote
## A remote voting system

In the short term, this system is intended to be used by Occupations at their Generale Aseemblies to enable remote participation. This is my solution to the dwindling numbers of ordinary middle class families at the GA's. I theorize the trend of dwindling numbers will only increase as the winter months set in.
*******************************************************************************************************************
This is how I picture the software working:

- A user goes to their local Occupation and is given a voter registration card. Voter registration does not require any personal information. The voter registration card will have a unique registration number that the user will be required to enter upon registering on the website.
- Once the user has registered they can view and "upvote" proposals (much like on Reddit), reply to proposals, or offer amendments to the proposals. All of these types of content can be upvoted. The upvoting of a proposal *is not* a binding vote. It simply gives the Facilitators an idea of what proposals matter to the GA.
- Once the Facilitators officially bring a proposal to the GA users can discuss further and participate in a "binding vote". The binding vote is intended to be honored as a real vote at the GA. Voting would be open for 24 hours after the actual GA.
- The results of the vote will be announced at the following GA.

I feel I must emphasize that this process is entirely up to debate, and if anyone has any further thoughts on how this could work, I encourage you to contact me.

### Intended method of distribution

I wanted to combine high functionality with ease of deployment. I feel that Youtube is a good example of this. Their system works by allowing users to embed iFrames into their own site that points back to Youtube. I want to do the same here, so it doesn not take a Rails expert to deploy this, and it will be compatible with ALL platforms (Wordpress, Drupal, etc). Theoretically, using this method it could be embedded in an email, or any other unfilterd HTML based medium for that matter.
*******************************************************************************************************************
Currently this software *is not* an official endeavor. I wanted to build the software *and then* present it to the Occupy Philadelphia (my local Occupation) GA and have their thoughts. I also would need to do some user testing to make sure the process actually works.
